            Hi, welcome to my personal website.
            I started developing this webpage on June 15th, 2023 with three goals in mind:
            <ol>
                <li>I wanted it to be extremely fast</li>
                <li>I wanted it to be unique and pretty</li>
                <li>I wanted it to use ZERO third party libraries.</li>
            </ol>
        </p>
        From the first goal, I decided to challenge myself to create the fastest webserver possible.
        To me, this meant using one of the fastest programming languages out there. Namely, C.
        Having little to no prior experience in C programming, I convinced myself that learning a new language
        would be both fun and helpful in the future.
