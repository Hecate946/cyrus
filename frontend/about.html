        Hi! I started developing this webpage on June 15th, 2023 with three goals in mind:
        to learn C, css, and javascript. As a result, the backend webserver is written from scratch in C,
        and the frontend is written entirely with vanilla html/css and javascript.
        This website is 100% open source, and you'll find that running it is remarkably easy if you have a linux machine ;)

        this is the second paragraph and the frontend is written entirely with vanilla html/css and javascript.
