    <h1 class="typewriter">Hi!</h1>
    <p class="typewriter">
        I started developing this webpage on June 15th, 2023 with three goals in mind:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li class="typewriter">1. To create a fast and unique website.</li>
        <li class="typewriter">2. To use ZERO third party libraries.</li>
        <li class="typewriter">3. To get better at C, JS, and CSS programming.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3 class="typewriter">Design:</h3>
    <p class="typewriter">
        To make this website as fast as possible, the backend webserver is written entirely in C.
        This webserver also uses a hashtable and linked list to store HTTP request data in a LRU cache for maximum speed and efficiency.
        Additionally, the backend features an API found at the /api endpoint.
        For transparancy, this API is fully available for any website user to visit and explore.
    </p>
    <p class="typewriter">
        The frontend is written with nothing more than simple HTML/CSS and vanilla JS.
        Please note that my initial goal of using zero third party libraries is still upheld.
        This website was created primarily for me to gain familiarity with a variety of programming concepts,
        and I felt as though using third party libraries such as jQuery, Bootstrap, or even external C libraries,
        would only cheat me out of learning the fundementals the right way.
    </p>
    <h3 class="typewriter">Source:</h3>
    <p class="typewriter">
        This website is 100% open source and can be found on github at:
    </p>
    <a href="https://github.com/Hecate946/cyrus" class="typewriter redirect", target="_blank">https://github.com/Hecate946/cyrus</a>
    <p class="typewriter">
        An added bonus of not using any external libraries is making the webpage super easy for people to run themselves.
        As long as you have the gcc compiler installed, running this website locally is as easy as cloning the github and running ./start
